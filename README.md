# Assorted Misc and Utilities for Smash 64

This holds a bunch of half finished tools, projects, and conveniences for me. Maybe they'll be of help to other people too!

## Currently Included
### /f3dex2/ - F3DEX2 / F3DZEX Macros for Bass
Bass macros for Nintendo's original C macros for their F3DEX2 graphics library.

### /utils/js/obj-to-f3de2
A very basic, not really usable converter from wavefront .obj files to a bass
compatible format. I will probably re-write this rust, especially since there
already is a good .obj parser

### /utils/rust/sym2nbm
A utility to convert the symbol output text file from bass into a nemu bookmarks
file for debugging

### /utils/lua
Various lua scripts (probably for BizHawk)
#### ssb64-camera.lua
Manually change battle camera parameters. Usefully for capture images of stages
